# peasy-pycheck

Python Code Checker and Formatter for Geany IDE based on [Peasy](https://github.com/kugel-/peasy)


## Requires Any one formatter. I personally use black

 - [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) [If supported]
`pip install black`


 - [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf)
``pip install yapf``

## Requires a checker such as `flake8`.


#### [NOTE] Donot mix both formatter.
